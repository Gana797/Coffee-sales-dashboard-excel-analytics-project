# Coffee-sales-dashboard-excel-analytics-project
DESCRIPTION
--> Background
The café and beverage industry is highly competitive, where businesses must monitor their sales performance closely to make informed decisions. Analyzing product sales, customer trends, and category-wise performance helps businesses stay agile and meet consumer demands effectively.

This project focuses on building a dynamic Excel dashboard for a coffee sales business to help visualize and interpret their performance metrics clearly.

--> Objective
A coffee-based retail business wants to build an interactive Sales Dashboard to track sales metrics, such as revenue, quantity sold, and category trends.
The dashboard should include:

Product Category controls to filter data dynamically

Month-wise and product-wise trend analysis

Regional performance visualization

This helps management make data-driven decisions and identify high-performing products and areas.

We will be using two files:

coffeeOrdersData.xlsx – Raw dataset containing order-level data

CoffeeSalesDashboardProject.xlsx – Final dashboard output with charts and interactivity

The dataset includes the following fields:

Field	Description
Order ID-Unique ID assigned to each transaction

Order Date-Date the coffee order was placed

Ship Date-Date the order was delivered

Product Category-Type of coffee product (Espresso, Latte, etc.)

Product-Specific product name

Sales-Total value of the sale

Quantity-Number of units ordered

Discount-Discount applied on the order

Profit-Profit gained from the order

Shipping Cost-Delivery charge associated with the order

Region-Geographic region of delivery

Customer ID-Unique customer identifier

Customer Name-Full name of the customer

Months-Month extracted from the order date

-->Using Excel, the following steps were performed to create a business-ready dashboard:

Created a Histogram to analyze the number of shipping days (Aging column).

Developed a ‘Working Sheet’ containing:

Month-wise Sales and Profit Table

Region-wise Sales Summary

Added a User Control Combo Box for selecting Product Category.

Designed Column Charts for:

Monthly sales and profit trend

Regional sales performance

Linked charts dynamically to the Combo Box selection.

Compiled all visuals and metrics into a professional Dashboard layout.

--> Outcome
The final Excel Dashboard provides:

Insightful sales patterns per product and region

Easy-to-use category filtering

Month-over-month performance monitoring

This project demonstrates how Excel can be used to build a real-time, interactive analytics solution with zero coding, making it ideal for small businesses and analysts.
